Design and Implementation of RISC-V IP with Hard Macro Creation and Integration

Objective
Design and Implemented RISC-V IP with Hard Macro Creation and Integration.

Key Focus Areas
Designed and implemented two hard macros for RISC-V sub-modules, meeting area, power, and performance constraints.
Integrated the hard macros into the top-level design with optimized floor planning, placement, and routing.
Optimized design to meet timing closure and power constraints using static timing analysis.

Inputs to Physical Design
Netlist (.v): A logical representation of the design, typically in formats like Verilog or VHDL, that specifies the circuit's connectivity.
Liberty File (.lib): Contains information about the timing, power, and functional characteristics of standard cells used in the design.
Design Constraints File (.sdc): Specifies timing, area, and power constraints for the design.
Technology File (.tf): Includes details about the manufacturing process, such as metal layer stack-up, design rules, and parasitic models.
Library Exchange Format (.lef): Describes the physical design rules & abstract views of the standard cells, macros.
Design Exchange Format (.def): Describes the design layout, including floorplan, cell placement, and routing information.
Power Intent File (.upf): Specifies the power domains and power management strategies for low-power designs.
Table Lookup Plus File (.tluplus): These files are crucial in the backend flow of VLSI physical design, specifically for parasitic extraction and delay calculation. They provide interconnect resistance and capacitance values.

Creating Macros
Here we have 30 Verilog files. Among those files, two blocks, ALU and Machine Counter, were converted into hard macros using the following tools:
Design Compiler
ICC2
LM Shell (Library Manager)
Synthesis and Physical Design
Synthesis: The process of converting the functional behavioral RTL into a gate-level netlist. Synthesis is done using Synopsys Design Compiler.
Physical Design: The process of transforming a gate-level netlist into a physical layout on a chip (GDS II). The conversion from GLN to GDS II is performed using Synopsys ICC2.
Hard Macro Creation: Hard macros are created by reading the GDS II files into the Library Manager and converting the GDS file into an NDM file.
