"# RISC-V-Hard-Macros-Integration-Technology-32nm" 
Objective: Design and Implemented RISC -V IP with Hard Macro Creation and Integration
Key Focus Areas:
1.	Designed and implemented two hard macros for RISC-V sub modules, for meeting area, power, and performance constraints.
2.	Integrated the two hard macros into the top-level design with optimized floor planning, placement, Clock Tree Synthesis and routing.
3.	Optimized design to meet timing constraints using static timing analysis.

Creation of Macros:
Alu and Machine Counter undergoes synthesis and pnr flow and then with help of library manager (lm_shell) macros are created.

 Why is Synthesis Important? 
• Bridges the Gap: It translates abstract RTL into real hardware components. 
• Ensures Efficiency: Through optimization, synthesis ensures designs meet power, performance, and area (PPA) targets. 
• Facilitates Validation: Post-synthesis verification ensures functional and timing correctness.
